## Tasks

### 1. Initial Setup and Navigation
- Launch Chrome browser in headless mode
- Navigate to bestbuy.com (or any similar e-commerce site)
- Implement a robust wait strategy for dynamic elements

### 2. Product Category Analysis
- Navigate to the Laptops category
- Apply filters for:
  - Price range: $500-$1500
  - Brand: Top 3 manufacturers
  - Customer Rating: 4+ stars
- Extract product data including:
  - Product name
  - Price
  - Rating
  - Number of reviews
  - Specifications

### 3. Advanced Data Collection
- For each product in the filtered list:
  - Click through to the product details page
  - Collect detailed specifications
  - Extract all customer reviews (implement pagination handling)
  - Store raw data in JSON format
  - Handle cases where elements might not be present
  - Implement rate limiting to avoid being blocked

### 4. Data Processing and Analysis
- Create an Excel workbook with multiple sheets:
  - Sheet 1: Product Summary
    - Apply conditional formatting for pricing
    - Create pivot tables for brand analysis
    - Add data validation for filtering
  - Sheet 2: Specifications Comparison
    - Create a comparison matrix
    - Highlight key differentiating features
  - Sheet 3: Review Analysis
    - Perform sentiment analysis on reviews
    - Calculate sentiment scores
    - Generate word clouds of common terms
    - Create visualizations for review trends

### 5. Automated Report Generation
- Create a PDF report containing:
  - Executive summary of findings
  - Price trend analysis with charts
  - Review sentiment analysis visualizations
  - Competitive analysis of brands
  - Top products recommendations based on multiple criteria

### 6. Data Visualization Dashboard
- Create an HTML dashboard using plotly/dash containing:
  - Interactive price comparison charts
  - Review sentiment trends
  - Brand performance metrics
  - Save the dashboard as a static HTML file

### 7. Error Handling and Logging
Implement comprehensive error handling for:
- Network issues
- Missing elements
- Rate limiting detection
- Invalid data formats
- Create detailed logs of the entire process

### Bonus Challenges
1. Implement multi-threading for faster data collection
2. Add email notification system for long-running processes
3. Create a simple REST API to query the collected data
4. Implement caching mechanism for improved performance
5. Add support for multiple e-commerce platforms
